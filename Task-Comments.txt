APP FEATURES:

- This shopping app task is designed and developed by me, The design idea is got it from the different resources thorugh 
the internet. 

- I made sure to follow the instructions outlined in the 'mobile-task.txt' file that I received via email.

- The Shop filters implemented through frontend.

- For Rest APIS integration I have used the fakes store api which can be found through link (https://fakestoreapi.com).

- All filters implmented in the shop except for relevant / irrelevant products, This is quite simple but due The reason to 
not implment is that the Fake Store API doesn't provide the information needed for that.


STEPS TO TEST THE APP:

To test the app, just follow these two simple steps:

1 - npm install
2 - npx expo start -c
